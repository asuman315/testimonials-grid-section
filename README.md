# testimonials-grid-section
A testimonials grid section built with HTML5 and CSS3.

# Overview
My challenge was to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users should be able to view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

### Built with
- Flexbox
- Advanced CSS Grid
- Mobile first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Links
- Live Site URL: []

### Challenges and what I learned
I found it challenging and frustrating to get the div containers ( in the desktop version of the testimonial section) have the same height while I was using the advanced CSS Grid. I managed to find my way around it through a couple of google searches. All I had to do was set the height of the child div containers to 100%.

```css
        #testimonials .testimonial-grid {
        margin-bottom: 0;
        height: 100%;
    }
    
### Continued development
I'm going to keep working on and applying advanced CSS Grid to hone and perfect my skills.
